## Description & Screenshots

Food-form is a project realized with the help of modern web development tools such as React, React-form-hook, TypeScript, SCSS, and MaterialUI. The project provides an excellent experience of useability and appearance for users. In terms of how the project looks like I tried to implement best practices:

To prevent unnecessary rerenders and optimization improvement I used a well-known library (react-form-hook) to create form.
The project contains custom validation for potential users mistakes:

The user is informed about every step of the status of sending submitted data to the server. Here is an example of implementing a loader indicator from the MaterialUI library when the user waits for the answer:

In case of success the user receives information in the form of Alert from Material UI library,
Submitted Data is also displayed below submit button:

If the data transfer is unsuccessful, the user also gets information with the help of an Alert from the Material UI library with the response error message:

My application is user friendly so i made it responsive and here is example of how it looks like on Iphone 12 Pro:
